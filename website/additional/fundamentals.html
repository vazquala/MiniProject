                The fundamentals are something everyone who animates uses. Without them, animation would look unclear
                and unconvincing. It is important to know how to utilize the techniques the principles teach in order to
                make animations seem more alive.

                <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>
                    As said before, animation is extremely varied, which makes it extremely hard to define techniques
                    that work for all of its mediums. Fortunately, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas have already found
                    techniques that could be applied to any animation medium. These techniques, also known as the
                    “principles” or “fundamentals” of animation, are extremely important in conveying life-like and
                    readable movement. For organization, I will categorize these techniques into 3 main sections:
                    structuring, believability, and readability, though some of the fundamentals can cross into
                    multiple sections. It is also important to know that some animation styles tend to focus less on
                    some of these techniques than others.

                        <h4>Straight Ahead</h4>
                        <p>
                            This method of planning involves drawing frame after frame with no guidelines whatsoever.
                            Although this method is poor for planned out actions, it is great for spontaneous
                            and unpredictable movements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any complicated physics movement is hard to plan out due to the many variables to keep in
                            mind. If what you are animating is unpredictable, then you simply just draw frame after
                            frame based on what you know.

                        <h4>Pose to Pose</h4>
                        <p>
                            This method involves planning out actions by drawing the key poses first. Although it
                            isn’t great for unpredictability, it is great for actions that need careful planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to do pose to pose, you first mark down the key poses, which mark the starting
                            and final positions of whatever you are animating. You then fill in the extremes, which
                            mark the furthest and most anticipated poses. Breakdowns connect these extremes, and
                            finally, you inbetween to clarify <em>easing</em>.

                        <h4>Timing</h4>
                        <p>
                            The most common FPS is 24 FPS. In order to save time, many methods were made such as
                            stretching out frames. Drawing a frame out of the 24 for every second is called drawing
                            on ones. Holding a drawing for two frames out of the 24 for every second is called drawing
                            on twos, and so on. 24 can be evenly divided into 2, 3, and 4, which makes it the perfect
                            number while still being seen as clean.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            Slower actions appear better when drawn on twos since when on ones, it is much harder to
                            inbetween a tiny small distance. Faster actions tend to be on ones in order to make the
                            action seen and more clear. Camera movements should also be on ones to avoid jitteriness.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Spacing</h4>
                        <p>
                            The further or closer apart you put the drawings with each other affects the movement. If
                            there is only one frame in between two poses, it would make the action appear extremely
                            fast. If you put multiple frames in between two poses, it would make the action appear
                            slower.

                        <h4>Anticipation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Without property <em>anticipation</em>, viewers can miss an action, which might leave them
                            confused. If an action must be seen, it should be anticipated clearly before the
                            action takes place. This can be done wind up or another action that sets up the main
                            action. The greater the <em>anticipation</em>, the more powerful the main action will feel.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            <em>Anticipation</em> can also increase believability. When someone is about to do an action,
                            they typically do a smaller action for preparation.

                        <h4>Staging</h4>
                        <p>
                            <em>Staging</em> involves making the presentation of a scene very clear. If staged right, the mood
                            you are trying to convey or the main action you are animating should be obvious. If staged
                            poorly, viewers could miss the scene’s entire point or miss an important action, which
                            could cause confusion.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            The eye can only handle so many things at once. If multiple things are competing for
                            presence in a scene, the viewer might miss what you want to show. You should take time
                            establishing an action first before moving on to another action.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            Another way to stage is by camera work. The focus of the scene should be clear and not to
                            the side. You can make sure the viewer sees the focus by putting the main action near the
                            center of the screen.

                        <h4>Secondary Action</h4>
                        <p>
                            <em>Secondary action</em> is the idea of having another action to further emphasize the first
                            action. Secondary action must not block the primary action, it should be used to amplify
                            it. For example, if the primary action is someone walking, there are multiple <em>secondary
                            actions</em> that can be paired with a walk to make an emotion clear. If you make the person
                            walking hold a fist, they will appear mad. If they are hunched over, they will appear sad.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            <em>Staging</em> is very important when making <em>secondary action</em>. If you want to amplify an emotion,
                            you should make the <em>secondary action</em> go before or after the primary action so both actions
                            don’t go unnoticed.

                        <h4>Exaggeration</h4>
                        <p>
                            <em>Exaggeration</em> is meant to convey what you are trying to show clearly. It should not distort
                            what you are animating, but instead, make it more convincing. Too little <em>exaggeration</em> can
                            make the viewer miss what you are trying to show.

                        <h4>Squash and Stretch</h4>
                        <p>
                            Despite <em>squash and stretch</em> not being too prevalent in real life, it can help create more
                            dynamic movement along with emphasizing speed and stiffness. The faster the object is,
                            the more it will stretch when moving and the more it will squash when it impacts
                            something. The stiffer the object is, the less it will <em>squash and stretch</em> overall. This
                            technique can also be paired with <em>anticipation</em> to further exaggerate an action.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            It is important to keep the volume of the object consistent throughout, since if you don’t,
                            it would appear as if the object is growing or shrinking.

                        <h4>Follow Through & Overlapping Action</h4>
                        <p>
                            <em>Follow through</em> is the idea that different parts, like appendages, will drag with an offset
                            after an object moves. This occurs when something surrounding the main object isn’t rigid,
                            such as limbs or clothing. Once the object comes to a complete stop, it is put in a hold
                            state, and everything else will follow through during this state.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            The amount of drag given to something can change the appearance of its mass. The less it
                            bends, the stiffer it seems and vice versa.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Easing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Objects in real life don’t typically move with any acceleration. To achieve the effect of
                            acceleration, you want to spread out the drawings the more time passes. This will make the
                            object travel a bigger distance the more time there is, thus, making it accelerate.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            It is also important to note when to <em>ease</em>. If an object’s momentum suddenly shifts, let's
                            say it hits the ground, it would not accelerate before this occurs.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Arcs</h4>
                        <p>
                            <em>Arcs</em> are essential to making animations more realistic. If you want inbetween two poses,
                            most of the time an <em>arc</em> is used. This is because rotations typically don’t travel linearly,
                            but instead move like it's tracing a circle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Arcs</em>, when paired with a <em>follow through</em>, can make a character stopping seem more realistic.
                            When someone intentionally does a sudden stop after maintaining a huge acceleration,
                            they sort of appear to move kind of like a spring. This is because the body needs to
                            absorb the impact to not break any bones or cause damage.
