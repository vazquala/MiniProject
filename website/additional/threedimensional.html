            <p class="introduction">
                3D animation is something that became mainstream rather recently, with Toy Story bringing out its
                popularity. 3D animation has been made a lot more accessible over the years, now anybody with a
                decent enough computer can create a 3D animation.

                    For 3D animation, the entire character has to be created. Although this makes keeping a
                    character a consistent size easier, it is a lot harder to create a rig. In order for a 3D
                    animation to exist, a model first needs to be modeled and rigged. Unlike 2D, 3D models need to
                    be manipulated with joints in order to create movement rather than drawing each frame.

                            Creating an animation is a lot different in 3D. In order to have an animation, you have
                            to have a model to animate. To overly simplify this, this can be done by manipulating a
                            mesh by extruding faces, edges, and vertices. If you want to animate this mesh, you have
                            to make sure the topology won’t mesh up any parts where the character can bend.

                        <h4>Rigging</h4>
                        <p>
                            After creating a model, you have to rig it in order to animate it. In order to do this,
                            you set up bones, parts of the animation that make what you want to move rigid, in the
                            model. These bones have a pivot point where they bend and rotate.
