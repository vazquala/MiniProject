                            Puppeting in 2D animation is a process in animation that involves creating a puppet,
                            a character with movable limbs, rather than drawing a character every movement. Puppets
                            are typically rigged with a skeleton that gives the puppet a structure and joints that
                            allow that structure to move.

                        <p class="note">
                            Sometimes puppeting is paired with splined, hand-drawn animation in order to make movements
                            feel less still.
