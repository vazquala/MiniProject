                <h2>2D Animation</h2>
                <p>
                    2D animation has grown a lot over the years since hand-drawn animation. You no longer have to draw
                    every inbetween since you can now use a computer to calculate an inbetween for you.
                </p>

                    <h3>2D Quirks</h3>
                    <p>
                        2D animation is a lot different from 3D animation. For 2D, you don’t have to model the entire
                        environment. You also only have to draw the parts of a character that is facing the camera.
                        There are two main methods of animating characters in 2D, puppeting and a more traditional
                        hand-drawn method.
                    </p>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Puppeting</h4>
                        <p>
                            Puppeting in 2D animation is a process in animation that involves creating a puppet,
                            a character with movable limbs, rather than drawing a character every movement. Puppets
                            are typically rigged with a skeleton that gives the puppet a structure and joints that
                            allow that structure to move.
                        </p>
                        <p class="note">
                            Sometimes puppeting is paired with splined, hand-drawn animation in order to make movements
                            feel less still.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Hand-Drawn</h4>
                        <p>
                            Hand-drawn animation is a process in which no computer is used to inbetween. This is a much
                            lengthier process compared to puppeting and spline animation, but if done right, it can
                            make your animation seem more fluid and alive.
