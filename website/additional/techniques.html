                <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>
                    As said before, animation is extremely varied, which makes it extremely hard to define techniques
                    that work for all of its mediums. Fortunately, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas have already found
                    techniques that could be applied to any animation medium. These techniques, also known as the
                    “principles” or “fundamentals” of animation, are extremely important in conveying life-like and
                    readable movement. For organization, I will categorize these techniques into 3 main sections:
                    structuring, believability, and readability, though some of the fundamentals can cross into
                    multiple sections.

                    <h3>Structuring</h3>

                        <h4>Straight Ahead</h4>
                        <p>
                            This method of planning involves drawing frame after frame with no guidelines whatsoever.
                            Although this method is poor for planned out actions, it is great for spontaneous
                            and unpredictable movements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any complicated physics movement is hard to plan out due to the many variables to keep in
                            mind. If what you are animating is unpredictable, then you simply just draw frame after
                            frame based on what you know.

                        <h4>Pose to Pose</h4>
                        <p>
                            This method involves planning out actions by drawing the key poses first. Although it
                            isn’t great for unpredictability, it is great for actions that need careful planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to do pose to pose, you first mark down the key poses, which mark the starting
                            and final positions of whatever you are animating. You then fill in the extremes, which
                            mark the furthest and most anticipated poses. Breakdowns connect these extremes, and
                            finally, you inbetween to clarify easing.

                    <h3>Readability</h3>
                    <p>words</p>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Anticipation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Without property anticipation, viewers can miss an action, which might leave them
                            confused. If an action must be seen, it should be anticipated clearly before the
                            action takes place. This can be done wind up or another action that sets up the main
                            action. The greater the anticipation, the more powerful the main action will feel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anticipation can also increase believability. When someone is about to do an action,
                            they typically do a smaller action for preparation.

                        <h4>Staging</h4>
                        <p>
                            Staging involves making the presentation of a scene very clear. If staged right, the mood
                            you are trying to convey or the main action you are animating should be obvious. If staged
                            poorly, viewers could miss the scene’s entire point or miss an important action, which
                            could cause confusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The eye can only handle so many things at once. If multiple things are competing for
                            presence in a scene, the viewer might miss what you want to show. You should take time
                            establishing an action first before moving on to another action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another way to stage is by camera work. The focus of the scene should be clear and not to
                            the side. You can make sure the viewer sees the focus by putting the main action near the
                            center of the screen.

                    <h3>Believability</h3>
                    <p>words</p>
                    <section>
                        <h4>Squash and Stretch</h4>
                        <p>
                            Despite squash and stretch not being too prevalent in real life, it can help create more
                            dynamic movement along with emphasizing speed and stiffness. The faster the object is,
                            the more it will stretch when moving and the more it will squash when it impacts
                            something. The stiffer the object is, the less it will squash and stretch overall. This
                            technique can also be paired with anticipation to further exaggerate an action.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to keep the volume of the object consistent throughout, since if you don’t,
                            it would appear as if the object is growing or shrinking.
