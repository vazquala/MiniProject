                Animation is an extremely varied medium that can help do things that aren’t possible in live action.
                It could also be used to exaggerate expressions and actions, which is why I like doing it as a hobby.
                Although I would still call myself a beginner, I would like to share all the things I’ve learned about
                what makes animation work.

                    Animation uses many techniques to convince viewers that a series of frames is movement. A list of
                    techniques called the “principles” has already been made to help with making an animation look alive
                    and appealing. There are also many other techniques that can help, but they are typically used in
                    different styles of animation.
