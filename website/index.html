            <p class="introduction">
                Animation is an extremely varied medium that can help do things that aren’t possible in live action.
                It could also be used to exaggerate expressions and actions, which is why I like doing it as a hobby.
                Although <strong>I would still call myself a beginner</strong>, I would like to share all the things I’ve learned about
                what makes animation work. I will cover (in order):

                        Animation uses many techniques to convince viewers that a series of frames is movement. A list of
                        techniques called the “principles” has already been made to help with making an animation look alive
                        and appealing. There are also many other techniques that can help, but they are typically used in
                        different styles of animation.

                    <h3>2D Animation Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        2D animation has grown over the years. Computers can now assist in creating inbetweens and
                        other methods to animate a 2D character have been created. It differs from 3D animation,
                        as you don’t get a clear image of the character's full rotation. If you want to start to 2D
                        animate, you could use:

                    <h3>3D Animation Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        3D animation mostly uses computers to interpolate the movements of an animation. This is
                        because a rig is modeled to have its joints selected and moved around rather than each frame
                        being drawn individually. If you want to start to 3D animate, you could use:

                    <p>
                        Animation, both 2D and 3D, has many usages. Specifically, animation appears a lot in movies and
                        video games. Since live action isn’t always affordable or possible, animation can fill in the
                        gap to create what you want to create. A list of games and movies that use animation greatly
                        can be found in this section.
